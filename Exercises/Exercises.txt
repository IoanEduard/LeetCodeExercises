Recursion - Easy

ğŸ’ª 1. Create a C# program that implements a recursive function that calculates the result of raising an integer to another integer. 
      This function must be created recursively.

Input: 2, 3
Output: 8
2*1=2
2*2 = 4
2*3 = 6;

2*2*2 = 8;
3^3;
3*3*3 = 9*3 

ğŸ’ª . Create a C# program that implements a recursive function called "Multiply" that receives two whole numbers requested from the user 
      and returns the result of its multiplication.

Input: 4, 4
Output: 16

ğŸ’ª 3. Create a C# program that uses recursion to calculate a number in the series of Fibonacci.
      In the Fibonacci series, the series begins with the numbers 0 and 1, from these, each term is the sum of the previous two.

Input: 13
Output: 233

Expected input and output
FibonacciNumber(3) â†’ 2
FibonacciNumber(7) â†’ 13

ğŸ’ª 4. Create a C# program that implements a recursive function that receives a requested number from the user and returns the factorial of that number. 
      You must calculate the factorial of the number using recursion.

Input: 6
Output: 720

5. Create a C# program that requests a string from the user and implements a recursive function to reverse a string of characters.

Input: Jonny
Output: ynnoJ

6. Create a C# program that implements a recursive function to check if a string is a palindrome or not. 
      A palindrome are strings that can be read equally from right to left, such as 'radar'.

Input: radar
Output: true

7. Given a positive integer, write a method that returns multiplication of all digits in the number.

Expected input and output
DigitsMultiplication(456) â†’ 120
DigitsMultiplication(123) â†’ 6

8. Given a non-negative integer, write a method that returns factorial of a number.

Expected input and output
Factorial(4) â†’ 24
Factorial(7) â†’ 5040

9. Given two integers a and b (a <= b) as range, write a method that returns multiplication of numbers from given range.

Expected input and output
NumbersMultiplication(5, 7) â†’ 210
NumbersMultiplication(50, 50) â†’ 50

10. Given two integers, write a method that returns first number raised to the power of second number.

Expected input and output
ToThePowerOfRecursion(2, 3) â†’ 8
ToThePowerOfRecursion(5, 2) â†’ 25

11. Given a string, write a method that prints it in reverse order.

Expected input and output
StringInReverseOrderRecursion("abcde") â†’ "edcba"
StringInReverseOrderRecursion("Sed lectus est, elementum ut urna eu") â†’ "ue anru tu mutnemele ,tse sutcel deS"

12. Given a string, write a method that checks if it is a palindrome. String length may be >= 0.

Expected input and output
IsPalindromeRecursion("xx") â†’ true
IsPalindromeRecursion("pendrive") â†’ false

13. Given an array of integers and array's length, write a method that returns its minimum element.

Expected input and output
 MinimumElement([8, 5, 9], 3) â†’ 5
 MinimumElement([-2, -9, 2, -3, 1, 0], 6) â†’ -9
